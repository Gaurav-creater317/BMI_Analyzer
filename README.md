# BMI-Calculator

💡 Introduction
As part of my web development learning journey, I created a fun and useful project — a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator. This helped me practice HTML form inputs, JavaScript logic, and CSS styling in a real-world mini-project.

In this blog, I'll walk you through the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code I used to build it — and share what I learned along the way.

⚙️ What is BMI?
BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It is a simple formula used to check if a person has a healthy weight.

📌 Formula:

BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]²

Based on your BMI, you can be categorized as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.
